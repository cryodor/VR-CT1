Training app for aero engine repair.

This application is an instructional app designed to demonstrate to all users how blades would be removed from a fan assembly in an engine. The procedure for the removal of blades ensures that the user has to wear their saftey equipment before engaging with the device.

The user interacts with props in the scene to remove the blade by placing the "soft punch" against a blade and striking the punch with the hammer, held in the other hand.
